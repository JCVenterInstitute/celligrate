title: Welcome to Celligrate!
---

**Celligrate** is a project to develop an essential software suite for *downstream* cell type characterization and integration of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Celligrate includes two customized learning methods: the [NS-Forest](https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/NSForest)  (a machine learning-based method for necessary and sufficient marker gene selection for each cell type) and [FR-Match](https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/FRmatch) (a statistical learning method for cluster-to-cluster cell type matching) developed by our group. The use of Celligrate extends the utility of the upstream scRNA-seq analysis pipelines to downstream use cases, and ultimately accelerates the growth of knowledge about cell types by pooling results from individual studies.
